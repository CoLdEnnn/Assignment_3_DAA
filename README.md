### Course Assignment 3
Optimization of a City Transportation Network using Minimum Spanning Tree algorithms (Prim’s and Kruskal’s).

### Project Overview
This project models a city transportation network as a weighted undirected graph,
where:
- Vertices represent city districts
- Edges represent possible roads
- Weights represent construction costs

The goal is to connect all districts with the minimum total road cost, ensuring every district is reachable —
that is, to find a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). Two classic algorithms are implemented and compared:
- Prim’s Algorithm
- Kruskal’s Algorithm
